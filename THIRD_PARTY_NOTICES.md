# Third-party notices

`dissect.archive` is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later (see `LICENSE` and `COPYRIGHT`).

The TIBX ("archive3") parser in `dissect/archive/tibx/` is a clean reimplementation in
Dissect idioms — no third-party code is vendored — but the format knowledge and the
structure of several algorithms derive from the two MIT-licensed projects below. Their
licenses require that the following notices be preserved.

## acronis-tib-reader ("tibread")

MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 the tibread contributors
<https://github.com/TreadingTheTiber/acronis-tib-reader>

The LSM index engine and the layers built on it. Derived work, by module:

- `dissect/archive/tibx/lsm.py` — L-SB superblock parsing, the ARCH TLV directory,
  LEAF/LDIR page framing and the cell-stream grammar (`tibread/tibx/lsm.py`,
  `tibread/tibx/lsm_cells.py`)
- `dissect/archive/tibx/map.py` — `data_map` extent decoding and `segment_map`
  index construction (`tibread/tibx/data_map.py`, `tibread/tibx/segment_map.py`)
- `dissect/archive/tibx/segment.py` — SG segment header parsing and segment
  decompression (`tibread/tibx/segment.py`)
- `dissect/archive/tibx/crypto.py` — the wrapped-key blob layout, KEK derivation and
  segment decryption (`tibread/tibx/encryption.py`)

## acronis-tibx

MIT License, Copyright (c) 2026 mniedermaier

A research project by mniedermaier that is no longer publicly available. It vendored the
`tibread` engine above and built a container layer, codecs and tooling on top. Derived
work, by module:

- `dissect/archive/tibx/c_tibx.py` — the format findings that the structure definitions
  encode
- `dissect/archive/tibx/page.py` — the 4 KiB page store and superblock/commit-root model
  (`tibx/container.py`)
- `dissect/archive/tibx/codec.py` — the zstd frame, linked-LZ4 and LSM cell-stream
  decoders (`tibx/codecs.py`)
- `dissect/archive/tibx/crypto.py` — the SE header and password-to-data-key flow
  (`tibx/crypto.py`)
- `dissect/archive/tibx/lsm.py`, `dissect/archive/tibx/map.py` — LSM mem-tree (C0)
  reading, merged into the extent and segment-index loaders
- `dissect/archive/tibx/segment.py` — the `comp=0x0001` (LZ4 / stored) segment variant
- `tests/_synth.py` — the synthetic archive fixtures
